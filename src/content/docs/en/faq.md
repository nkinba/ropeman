## Privacy & Data

### Is my original source code ever sent to an external server?

Rest assured — your original source code is **never** transmitted externally under any circumstances. Only minimal code structure information (metadata) is used for AI context, and it is handled securely based on your chosen AI mode.

- **WebGPU mode (highest security)**: Processed 100% offline on your device. No data leaves your machine.
- **Demo / API Key mode**: Routed through a secure relay server to the AI model provider. The relay never stores the payload.
- **Bridge mode**: Sent directly to the AI provider via your locally installed CLI tool — Ropeman's servers are not involved.

For a full breakdown, see [Security](/docs/en/security).

### Are my API keys stored securely?

API keys are never stored on Ropeman's servers — they are kept only in your browser on your device.

- **API Key mode**: Keys are attached only at the moment of an API call and securely transmitted to the AI model provider via the edge proxy.
- **Bridge mode**: No API key input is needed. It inherits the authentication of your locally configured CLI tool.
- **WebGPU mode**: Runs offline, so no API key is required at all.

You can delete keys anytime from **Settings → Reset Settings**.

### What exactly is in the "code structure summary"?

Function and method signatures, class declarations, import/export statements, and top-level type definitions. **Not** included: function bodies, inline comments, string literals, or configuration values. The summary is capped at 250 KB by default and is adjustable in Settings.

## Languages & Projects

### What programming languages are supported?

Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C, C++, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, C#, and Scala.

### Are there project size limits?

Up to **2,000 files** and **500 KB per individual file**. For large projects, adjust the code structure summary size limit in **Settings**, or open one subdirectory at a time.

### Can Ropeman handle mixed-language projects?

Yes. The in-browser parser handles each file by its extension, and the AI reasons across language boundaries when generating the diagram. A typical Python backend + TypeScript frontend monorepo works fine.

### What happens if a file fails to parse?

Unparseable files are skipped silently and do not block the rest of the project. You can see per-file status in the file explorer. Parse errors are usually caused by unsupported language dialects or files exceeding the 500 KB cap.

## Usage & Features

### How do I drill down into a diagram?

**Double-click** any node on the canvas. Ropeman sends the sub-region's code structure summary back to the AI and renders a fresh diagram for that scope. Use the **breadcrumb** at the top to navigate back up.

### Can I use Ropeman commercially?

Yes. Ropeman is a visualization tool — analyzing your own code, whether personal or commercial, is fully supported. The tool itself is provided as-is from [ropeman.dev](https://ropeman.dev). If you use **Demo** mode, remember the shared quota is for evaluation; switch to **API Key** or **Bridge** for sustained professional use.

### Does Ropeman work offline?

Partially. Once the page is loaded, **WebGPU mode** is fully offline. Other modes require a network connection for the AI call. If you need to work air-gapped, use WebGPU and pre-download the model weights.

### What happens to my diagrams when I close the tab?

Analysis results are cached in your browser and restored on the next visit. They persist until you clear site data or click **Clear Cache** in Settings.

## Compatibility

### Which browsers are supported?

**Chrome** and **Edge** (Chromium-based) are fully supported, including the File System Access API. **Firefox** and **Safari** work via drag-and-drop folder upload but cannot use the folder picker dialog. **WebGPU mode** additionally requires Chrome 113+ or Edge 113+ with a compatible GPU.

### Why does the folder picker not show up in Firefox?

Firefox does not yet implement `showDirectoryPicker()`. Use drag-and-drop instead — drop a folder anywhere on the landing page and Ropeman will read it recursively.

### I use Safari. What should I expect?

Drag-and-drop folder upload works. File System Access API features (live re-reads) and WebGPU mode are unavailable. Demo, API Key, and Bridge modes otherwise function normally.

### Can I analyze a GitHub repository by URL?

Yes. Paste a public GitHub repository URL into the input field on the landing page and click **Load**. Ropeman fetches the file structure and analyzes it just like a local folder. Private repositories are not supported.

### Can I share my analysis results?

Yes. After AI analysis completes, click the **Share** button in the header to generate a public link. You can share this link with anyone to let them view the analysis.
